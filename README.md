Flashcards for ANKI covering a standard course in theoretical physics - in german language
A guide on how to create new flashcards and how to efficiently import them into ANKI will be included later on.
The concept has initially been developed by a fellow student at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe - University in Frankfurt am Main to be supportive for students who cover physics as their subsidiary subject.
It has been further refined here to use the latest features of ANKI to cover the vast expanse of a general course for theoretical physics, omitting the depth that went into the original concept (it's already almost too much to handle for a single person).
The cards are based on a standard course for theoretical physics and can be used as supplement for a better learning experience.
